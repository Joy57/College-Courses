What is the output of the code? 
The output of the code for each task has been screenshotted and included within the folder.

What does the code do?
Task1:
This code creates an array of thread. The num of threads are limited to 5.
Creates thread inside the loop. pthread_exit() function was called at the end inside the main,
it terminates the calling thread and returns a value 
In the output window, it prints out the thread id while creating each thread (Refer to screenshot task1).

Task2:
This code creates seperate independent threads that can execute function. I have used thread_join function
to wait for one thread to terminate while other is about to proceed. When a pthread_join() returns successfully, 
the target thread has been terminated.
In the output, it prints out the thread message and returns the value of for each thread (Refer to screenshot task2).

Task3:
Uses a global variable for counter. 
The mutex object referenced by mutex is locked by calling pthread_mutex_lock(). 
If the mutex is already locked, the calling thread blocks until the mutex becomes available. 
This operation returns with the mutex object referenced by mutex in the locked state with the calling thread as its owner.
And then pthread_mutex_unlock() function releases the mutex object referenced by mutex. 

Prints counter value one after another. In this case it creates two thread, hence , counter 1 and 2 were the output (Refer to screenshot task3)
